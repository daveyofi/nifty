# Nifty Web Design  

Each year (since 2019) I collect about fifty new websites that appear this particular year. Such websites mainly have top-notch design and awesome concepts. There is no preference by style. All web design styles are welcome: minimalism, digital product, business classic, bauhaus, brutalism, cyberpunk, etc.  
  
All of the collections are different by design which created with one of the popular online website builder software like Webflow, Wix, Weebly, Google Sites, etc.
